Plain past: 食べた (Tabeta)
Polite present: 食べます (Tabemasu)
Polite past: 食べました (Tabemashita)
Negative: 食べない (Tabenai)
Te-form: 食べて (Tabete)

Japanese/English (日/英) - This key is used to toggle between Japanese and English input modes on a keyboard. When typing in Japanese, you can use a combination of hiragana, katakana, and kanji characters. This key allows a user to switch from a Japanese input method, like an IME (Input Method Editor), to English input, where the keyboard behaves like a standard QWERTY keyboard.

Half-width/Full-width (半/全) - These keys are used to switch between half-width and full-width characters. In Japanese typing, half-width refers to characters that take up half the space of a standard square character block, which is the space typically occupied by one kanji character. Full-width characters, on the other hand, occupy the full square. This is particularly relevant for characters like katakana, which can be typed in half-width to save space, or full-width for standard text alignment and readability. It's also used for alphanumeric characters in various contexts to match the aesthetics or formatting rules of Japanese text.

Half-width Katakana (半角カナ) - This key might be used to specifically switch to a half-width katakana input mode. Katakana is one of the three scripts used in Japanese writing and is often used for foreign words, technical terms, company names, and for emphasis, similar to italics in English.


英 (Ei) - This stands for "English". It indicates the key can be used to switch the keyboard to English input mode.

かな (Kana) - This is short for "Katakana/Hiragana". It represents the Japanese syllabary, indicating that the keyboard can be switched to input Japanese characters.

The other two symbols you see are likely to be representations of:

半 (Han) - This symbol means "half-width". It is used to switch to half-width characters, which are narrower versions of the full-width characters. Half-width characters are often used for Latin letters and numbers in Japanese text to save space and align neatly with other Japanese characters.

全 (Zen) - This stands for "full-width9". It switches to full-width characters, which are the standard width for Japanese text. Full-width characters take up the space of a square, aligning neatly with kanji and kana characters.
