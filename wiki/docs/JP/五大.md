The Five Elements (五大, Godai)

In Japanese philosophy, there are five primary elements that are believed to make up everything in the universe. These are:

    1.    Earth (土, Tsuchi or Do): Solidity and stability. Physical objects and matter.
    2.    Water (水, Mizu or Sui): Fluidity, adaptability, and change. Emotions and intuition.
    3.    Fire (火, Hi or Ka): Energy, force, and movement. Passion, creativity, and motivation.
    4.    Wind (風, Kaze or Fū): Freedom, expansion, and movement. Intellect and communication.
    5.    Void or Ether (空, Kū or Sora): Represents the absence of all elements, the space in which everything exists. It is associated with spirituality, creativity, and the boundless potential for growth and change.
