KORIN.WIKI Home
======
This project will be a personal wiki in the vein of [gwern.net](https://gwern.net): [About](https://gwern.net/About), [Code](https://github.com/gjord/gwern.net)

To do something exactly would require Haskell (their page is built on Hykell), and I should consider just doing a Gatsby/Mkdocs/Jekyll/etc.

> In Esperanto io as an independent word is the assertive existential indefinite pronoun (English "something"). As a suffix, -io is used to terminate official names of countries or other kind of lands under which a community of people are grouped. The Plena Ilustrita Vortaro de Esperanto include almost 500 terms like that, from Abisenio (former name of Ethiopia, Etiopio) to Zambio (Zambia). Derived from that, the suffix is also used to designate a community of people whose common interest is indicated by the suffixed root, especially in the term Esperantio, the community of speakers of the language and their culture as a whole, as well as the places and institutions where the language is used. As of May 2020, the esperant.io domain name itself redirect to Libera Folio, an independent generalist online bulletin written in Esperanto.
