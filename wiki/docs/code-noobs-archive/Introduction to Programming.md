Week 1: Numbers, Variables, Strings
-----------------------------------

Strings, Numbers, and Variables are as they sound, but with caveats/details.

> A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence. But one special thing about variables is that their contained values can change.

[Tags, Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element), [Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Selectors)

You might be familiar with some of the following:

These are all tags of the respective element they represent, there's a (frowned-upon) in-line CSS style that selects the .body class to declare changes to what it has selected (the body everything on the page)

TL;DR
-----

We introduced the term[ Data Types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures), but it wasn't covered. We skipped to variables because it defines itself and due to the remaining the time we had. After this meeting, you should understand the internet uses packets to send and receive data (using the TCP/IP protocol) and JavaScript is what causes the interaction/behind-the-scenes of the page.

Do some research on [HTML/CSS](https://webbhost.net/colorgame.html), we'll do a primer on it next week, and start with DataTypes in JS. We'll do a couple of exercises and see where we're at.
