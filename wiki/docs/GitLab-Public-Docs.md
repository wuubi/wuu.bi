If you try to download a "Free" PDF from GitLab (not free as free beer), you must share a "Work Email" address first, but this seems a bit backwards. I'm sharing these docs publicly here, but can move them to a private directory if requested and suggest in either updating this copy or process to the rightful copyright holders.
