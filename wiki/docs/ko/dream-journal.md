## Intro

I'm of the opinion that we as a society have become increasingly disinterested in the abstract,  especially thoughts like dreams, and that we'd all benefit from investing more time in those abstractions. For that reason, I journal dreams when I can, especially when overly emotional, lucid, etc.

Last night's wasn't super interesting, unfortunately, but I dreamed I was on Discord (yes the chat app) in voice chat. I'm not sure what this could be a signal for `/s`.
